                    <p><strong>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull 
                        and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during 
                        summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding
                         to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way
                          to get in real contact with the true reason behind
                          the name Ice-land!</strong></p>
